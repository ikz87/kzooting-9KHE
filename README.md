# THE KZOOTING PROJECT
UNI project, inspired on [wooting keyboards](https://next.wooting.io/).

Goal is to have:
1. Remapable capabilities via a TUI or GUI client ✔️
2. Rapid trigger ✔️
3. Macros ✔️

Project is done (most likely).

Check out the [kzooting GUI client](https://github.com/ikz87/kzooting-GUI)
